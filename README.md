# (Unofficial) Command X16 User's Guide

This User Guide for the Commander X16 (https://www.commanderx16.com) is meant
as a starting point for a crowd-sourced effort to create manual for our
favorite modern retro computer.  While the offical docs are useful as a
programmers reference, they simply do not meet the criteria that computer
manuals of the past met.  Specifically, this guide should be readable by
children, since the Command X16 designers were children when they read their
first computer manuals.  It should provide a step-by-step guide for setting up
the computer and starting to use it, allowing the reader to skip to sections of
interest at will.

If you would like to contribute, submit a pull request and I will try to review
it as soon as possible.
