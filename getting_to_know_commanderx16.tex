Congratulations!  Your Command X16 is up and running and ready to accept your
first commands.  When it starts, it should display a message at the top letting
you know that it is running BASIC and how much memory is available.  There will
also be a white blinking rectangle called a \emph{cursor}.  This is how the X16
signals that it is waiting for you.

\section{The Start Screen}

\screenbox{2.75in}{2in}{
	**** X16 BASIC ****\\
	512k HIGH RAM\\
	38655 BASIC BYTES FREE\\\\
	READY.\\
	\cursor
}


\begin{tcolorbox}[
		colback=white,
		colframe=blue,
		width=4.25in,
		height=2.1in,
		]

		\keybackgroundcolor{gray}
		\keytextcolor{black}

		{\sffamily\bfseries\fontsize{16pt}{16pt}\selectfont X16 TIP:\\}

		If you type a character on the screen that you don't want, press the
		\widekey{backspace} key.  This key will erase the character immediately
		to the left of the cursor.\\

		Use this key as often as you like to delete unwanted characters.

\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Experiment a little}

It's time to start pressing keys and giving your Commander X16 something to do!
Press the following keys:\\

\key{p} \key{r} \key{i} \key{n} \key{t}\\



As you press each key, the cursor moves to the right.  The cursor will always
show you where the next character will be typed.  Next, locate one of the
\keybackgroundcolor{gray}\widekey{shift} keys on the keyboard.  There will be
one on the right and one on the left, but they both do the same thing: modify another
key when pressed at the same time as \widekey{shift}.\\

Hold down the \widekey{shift} key and press the \keybackgroundcolor{white}\doublekey{"\\'} key.  The
screen should now look like this:\\

\screenbox{2.75in}{2in}{
	**** X16 BASIC ****\\
	512k HIGH RAM\\
	38655 BASIC BYTES FREE\\\\
	READY.\\
	PRINT"\cursor
}

Pressing the \doublekey{"\\'} key while holding down \keybackgroundcolor{gray}\widekey{shift} caused the
{\ttfamily "} character to by typed instead of the {\ttfamily '} character.\\

Now let't type a word.  Without holding down any other keys, press these keys:\\

\keybackgroundcolor{white}
\key{b} \key{u} \key{t} \key{t} \key{e} \key{r} \key {f} \key{l} \key{y}\\

Finally, hold down the \keybackgroundcolor{gray}\widekey{shift} key, and press the \keybackgroundcolor{white}\doublekey{"\\'} key one more time.  The screen should now show:\\

\screenbox{2.75in}{2in}{
	**** X16 BASIC ****\\
	512k HIGH RAM\\
	38655 BASIC BYTES FREE\\\\
	READY.\\
	PRINT"BUTTERFLY"\cursor
}

		Everything you typed is on this line.}
